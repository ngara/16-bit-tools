        <p>16-bit-tools is a collection of tools, mostly written in Python, for disassembling and understanding the internal workings of the Intel-8088 CPU and the original IBM PC computer.

<h3>Starting Out</h3>

<p>Here I am.  This is the first post on my journey to explore and understand the inner workings of the IBM PC.  Along the way, I plan to develop some tools to help deconstruct and understand whatever it is that I run across.</p>

<p>The first challenge I have decided to pursue is to attempt to disassemble the PC game XONIX.  It is a simple game, where you are a square attempting to move around the screen, and there is a bouncing square and a ball or two trying to stop you.  It looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://quadrax.wz.cz/app/images/xonix_dos.png" alt="XONIX.EXE" /></p>

<p>The directory listing for the Xonix game looks something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Directory of C:\GAMES\XT\XONIX\.
.              &lt;DIR&gt;            27-11-2020 19:35
..             &lt;DIR&gt;            27-11-2020 19:35
BASRUN   EXE              31744 05-07-1982 12:00
HISCORES XNX                256 02-08-1988 23:07
XONIX    BIN               4104 03-25-1984 14:11
XONIX    EXE               8576 03-25-1984 12:07
XONIX    SE                4096 03-25-1984 12:07
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The program is run by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XONIX</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XONIX.EXE</code> but it requires the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BASRUN.EXE</code> file to be available because it was originally a BASIC program compiled with the Microsoft Basic Compiler.  The original source code is not available on the Internet as far as I can tell.  If someone knows where to find it, please <a href="mailto:ngara23@gmail.com">contact me</a>.</p>

<p>I will start by running XONIX.EXE with a debugger: the recommended debugger is <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pcdosretro/enhdebug"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEBUGX</code></a>.  I will also be trying to use <a href="https://www.nasm.us/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NDISASM</code></a> on it, but I need a tool that will decode the MZ executable format in order to understand the executable better.  Thatâ€™s where <a href="https://github.com/ngara/16-bit-tools">16-bit-tools</a> will come in handy.</p>

<p>More to come.</p>
